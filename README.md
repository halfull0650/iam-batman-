batman and batmole

Batmanâ€™s on the rooftop high,  
Looking at the moonlit sky.  
His cape is flapping in the breeze,  
As he swings through Gotham trees.  



thatb bat man is mubashir     
mubashir is batman  ,peppole 
hidigng in the dark but iam  
the dark ,n iam vengnece     .



they think iam hidding in the shadows 
but iam the shadows
I am Batman, dark and bold,
In the night, my story's told.
With silent steps, I fight the crime,
A shadow moving out of time.
