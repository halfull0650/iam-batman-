batman and batmole

Batman’s on the rooftop high, 

Looking at the moonlit sky.

His cape is flapping in the breeze,

As he swings through Gotham trees.  



 
that bat man is mubashir  

mubashir is batman  ,peppole  

hidigng in the dark but iam  

the dark ,n iam vengnece 



they think iam hidding in the shadows 

but iam the shadows I am Batman,

dark and bold,In the night,

my story's told.With silent steps,

I fight the crime,A shadow moving out of time.



In quiet strength or laughter loud,

You stand out bright among the crowd.

A curious mind, a heart that’s true,

The world feels better thanks to you.
